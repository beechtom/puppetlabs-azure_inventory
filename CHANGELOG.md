### New features

* **Set `resolve_reference` task to private** ([#6](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-azure_inventory/pulls/6))

    The `resolve_reference` task has been set to `private` so it no longer appears in UI lists.

## Release 0.2.0

**Changes**

This converts the module to a Bolt plugin, which includes renaming the `inventory_targets` task to `resolve_references`.

## Release 0.1.0

This is the initial release.
